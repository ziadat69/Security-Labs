--> ifconfig

 Displays network interfaces and their configurations such as IP addresses, netmasks, and MAC addresses. It is commonly used for troubleshooting and verifying network connections.

--> ip a 

Shows network interfaces and their address information, similar to ifconfig but more modern and detailed. It is used to manage and display network addresses.

--> ip route show 

Lists the current routing tables of the system. It shows how traffic is being routed through the network.

-->  arp -a: 

Displays the ARP table, which maps IP addresses to corresponding MAC addresses. It is useful for checking local network connections.

--> ip neighbor 

Shows neighboring devices that can be reached over the network using the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) or ARP. It is helpful for network diagnostics.

--> pathping

A diagnostic tool that combines traceroute and ping to analyze the path and quality of a network connection. It provides detailed information about packet loss along the route.

--> nmap localhost

Scans the local machine to find open ports and services. Nmap is commonly used for security analysis.

--> nmap 172.16.232.132/24

Scans an entire subnet for active devices and open ports. It shows which hosts are up and which ports are accessible.

--> sudo nmap -sS 172.16.232.132

Performs a TCP SYN scan on a host to detect open ports. This method is faster and more stealthy than full connection scans.

--> nmap -A 172.16.232.132

Conducts a detailed scan that detects operating systems, services, versions, and potential vulnerabilities on the target system. It is used for comprehensive analysis.

--> nmap --top-ports 20 172.16.232.32/24

Scans the top 20 most commonly used ports within the specified subnet. It is useful for quickly checking frequently used ports.

-->  nmap -sn 172.16.232.0/24

Performs a host discovery scan to identify active devices on the network without scanning their ports. It is ideal for network overview.

--> curl -s -I (IP server)

Retrieves only the header of an HTTP request from a server, showing details like status code and server information. It is often used to quickly check if a server is reachable.

--> dig -x (IP website)

Performs a reverse DNS lookup to find the domain name associated with an IP address. It is useful for identifying hosts by their IP.

-->  dig soa 8.8.8.8

Queries the Start of Authority (SOA) record of a domain, providing information about the primary DNS server and who is responsible for the domain zone.
