‏1. **Turn off Antivirus**: 
‏   - Disabling antivirus is generally not recommended unless absolutely necessary for troubleshooting.
‏   - If you do disable it temporarily, ensure you re-enable it after completing your tasks.

‏2. **Suspicious Program ("Odyssee")**:
‏   - If the program contains malware, avoid downloading or running it.
‏   - Scan the system with a trusted antivirus or anti-malware tool like Malwarebytes.

‏3. **Suspicious Process ("ncat") in Task Manager**:
‏   - "ncat" is a legitimate network tool, part of Nmap, often used for network troubleshooting. However, it can be exploited maliciously.
‏   - Check if you’ve installed any network tools recently.
‏   - If the process appears without explanation, investigate further by checking the file path and running a virus scan on it.

‏4. **Malware Found in "Angry IP Scanner"**:
‏   - "Angry IP Scanner" is a network scanning tool, but if you're experiencing malware-related issues, remove the program and scan your machine.
‏   - Use a dedicated malware removal tool to scan for and remove any suspicious files.

‏5. **"Putty" Involvement**:
‏   - Putty is a legitimate SSH client, but if unauthorized connections are being made, it could be exploited for remote access.
‏   - Check for any unexpected connections or configurations.

‏To resolve the situation:

‏- **Uninstall any suspicious software** and remove any files associated with "Odyssee," "ncat," and "Angry IP Scanner."
‏- **Run a thorough malware scan** with a trusted antivirus.
‏- **Check your firewall and network settings** for unauthorized changes or open ports.
