To set up a lab for testing a **SYN Flood** DoS attack using **hping3**, we'll create a simple lab environment that includes an attacker and a target machine. We'll use **hping3** to launch the attack, monitor the traffic with tools like **Wireshark**, and apply mitigation techniques using **iptables**. Here's how to set up the lab step by step:

### **1. Setting up the Lab Environment**

#### **Requirements:**
- **Attacker Machine**: Any Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu).
- **Target Machine**: A web server running on Linux (e.g., Ubuntu).
- **VirtualBox** or any other virtualization software.

#### **Steps:**
- **Create two virtual machines**:
  - Set up two virtual machines using **VirtualBox**.
  - Make sure both machines are connected to the same network, either "Internal Network" or "Host-Only Adapter," so they can communicate.

### **2. Setting up the Target Server**

#### **Steps:**
1. **Install Apache on the Target Machine**:
   - Open the terminal on the target machine and install the Apache web server:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install apache2
     ```
   - Once installed, ensure the server is running:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start apache2
     sudo systemctl enable apache2
     ```
   - Verify that the web server is running by opening a browser and typing the target machineâ€™s IP address.

### **3. Setting up the Attacker Machine**

#### **Install hping3 on the Attacker Machine**:
1. On the attacker machine, open the terminal and install **hping3**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install hping3
   ```

2. **Launch a SYN Flood Attack using hping3**:
   - Once the tool is installed, use the following command to launch the attack:
     ```bash
     sudo hping3 -S --flood -V -p 80 <target IP address>
     ```
     - **-S**: Sends SYN packets.
     - **--flood**: Sends packets continuously without waiting for responses.
     - **-V**: Verbose mode for more detailed output.
     - **-p 80**: Targets port 80 (HTTP).

### **4. Monitoring Network Traffic using Wireshark**

#### **Install Wireshark on the Target Machine**:
1. On the target machine, install Wireshark:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install wireshark
   ```

2. **Start capturing traffic**:
   - Open Wireshark and select the network interface to monitor traffic.
   - Use the following filter to display only SYN packets:
     ```
     tcp.flags.syn == 1
     ```

### **5. Mitigating the Attack using iptables**

#### **Using iptables to mitigate the SYN Flood attack**:
1. On the target machine, apply the following rule to limit the rate of SYN packets:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn -m limit --limit 1/s -j ACCEPT
   ```
   - This command limits the server to accept only one SYN packet per second per connection.

2. **Enable SYN Cookies**:
   - You can also enable SYN cookies to reduce the impact of the attack:
     ```bash
     sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1
     ```

### **6. Analyze the Results and Create a Report**

#### **Analyzing the Attack**:
1. **Use Wireshark** to analyze traffic and count the number of SYN packets received.
2. **Monitor resource usage** on the target server during the attack with:
   ```bash
   top
   ```

#### **Create a Report**:
- Document the impact of the attack on the server, including resource usage and traffic load.
- Include the mitigation techniques applied and how effective they were.

By following these steps, you will have created a complete lab to test a **SYN Flood** attack using **hping3**, analyze the attack using **Wireshark**, and mitigate its effects using **iptables**. Let me know if you need further clarification or details on any of the steps!
