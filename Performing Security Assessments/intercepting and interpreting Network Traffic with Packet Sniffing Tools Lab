1. **Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN)**: 

SPAN is used to mirror or copy frames passing through designated source ports to a destination port. A packet sniffer or analyzer like Wireshark can be connected to the destination port for monitoring network traffic.

2. **Network Tap Hardware**: 

A physical network tap is a hardware device that allows network traffic to be monitored. It splits the traffic and sends a copy to a monitoring device without disrupting the flow of data.

1. **tcpdump**: 

     A command-line packet analyzer used to capture and display network traffic. It is widely used for network troubleshooting.

2. **tcpdump -i eth0**: 

     Captures and displays all network traffic on the network interface `eth0`. This command listens to all packets passing through that interface.

3. **tcpdump -vv 10.1.0.2 and port www -w ww.pcap**
      
      This command captures verbose output of traffic going to and from IP `10.1.0.2` on the HTTP port (80) and writes it to a file called `ww.pcap` for later analysis.

1. **Wireshark**:
        A graphical network protocol analyzer used to capture and analyze network packets in real-time. It provides a more user-friendly and visual interface compared to tcpdump.
